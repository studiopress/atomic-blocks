# LSX Blocks

The new Gutenberg editor is here, and with it comes the new block editor. 

We have built these content blocks so you can simply drag and drop them into your editor, configure to your wishes and you are done! 

Reminder: To make use of the LSX Blocks plugin, remember to have the [LSX Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/lsx/) installed and active. 

## Getting Started with LSX Blocks 

* Login to the backend of your Wordpress website.
* Navigate to the "Plugins" item in your dashboard
* Select "Add New"
* Search for "LSX Blocks" in the plugin search bar 
* Once you see the plugin, select "Install"
* Activate the plugin. 
* That's it, you can now make use of the LSX Blocks when building a new post or page!
