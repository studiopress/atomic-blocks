A collection of beautiful, customizable Gutenberg blocks for the new block editor.

== Description ==

Atomic Blocks has moved!

Same powerful blocks, same beautiful designs, same innovative team. Atomic Blocks has been renamed to Genesis Blocks. [Learn more about Genesis Blocks](https://studiopress.com/genesis-blocks/). With our migration tool built right into Genesis Blocks, the transition between plugins will be simple and seamless - plus you'll be ready to receive the new blocks and features we're releasing soon.

Atomic Blocks is a collection of page building blocks for the new [Gutenberg](https://atomicblocks.com/beginners-guide-gutenberg/?utm_source=WP.org%20Description%20Gberg%20Link&utm_campaign=wporg_desc_gberg_link) block editor. Building pages with the block editor and Atomic Blocks gives you more control to quickly create and launch any kind of site you want!

Installing the customizable Atomic Block plugin adds a collection of beautiful, site-building blocks to help you customize page layouts, increase engagement, and get results for your business. Atomic Blocks provides everything from customizable buttons, to beautifully-designed page sections and full-page layout designs via the Section & Layout block.

Along with the content blocks you'll find in Atomic Blocks, we're also publishing helpful articles and tutorials to help you get started with Gutenberg.

### New Section and Layout Block!

On top of the handy, time-saving blocks already found in Atomic Blocks, we're excited to introduce the brand new Section and Layout block! This block comes with a library of pre-designed sections and layouts to help you quickly and easily build a beautiful site with the new block editor.

Using the Section and Layout modal window, you can browse designs by category, search, and even add sections and layouts to a Favorites tab for quick access later. Paired with the free [Atomic Blocks theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/atomic-blocks/), which has support for full-width, block-based page building, you have everything you need to start building your site today!

AMP pages are specially designed for Google search users to quickly load website pages without using any extraneous data. Atomic Blocks has support for AMP built into each block!
